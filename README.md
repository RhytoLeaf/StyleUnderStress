# Style Under Stress

This project is a self-assessment tool designed to help you understand your communication style when faced with stressful situations. By answering a series of 33 questions, you will gain insight into how you typically react in crucial conversations, and whether you tend to move towards silence or violence.

## The Value of Self-Reflection

Understanding your style under stress is the first step towards more effective communication. This tool provides a mirror to your behavior, allowing you to identify patterns that may be hindering your ability to achieve your desired outcomes. By recognizing your tendencies, you can begin to make conscious choices to respond more productively in high-stakes conversations. This can lead to improved relationships, better problem-solving, and a greater sense of control in your personal and professional life.

This self-assessment is not a judgment of your character, but rather a tool for growth. It is an opportunity to develop self-awareness and cultivate a more skillful approach to communication, enabling you to navigate difficult conversations with grace and integrity.
