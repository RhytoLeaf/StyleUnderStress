          <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold">What Your Score Means:</h1>
          <p class="col-md-8 fs-4">

            <div id="meaning">
              <p>Your silence and violence scores give you a measure of how frequently you fall into these
                less-than-perfect
                strategies.</p>

              <h3>It's actually possible to score high in both.</h3>
              <p>A high score (one or two checked boxes per domain) means you use this technique fairly often. It also
                means
                you're human.</p>
              <p>Most people toggle between holding back and becoming too forceful.</p>

              <h3>If you score high (two or more domains)</h3>
              <p>You're already quite skilled in this area.</p>

              <h3>If you score low (zero or one)</h3>
              <p>You may want to pay special attention to these chapters.</p>

              <h3>These scores represent</h3>
              <p>How you typically behave during stressful or crucial conversations, but they can change.</p>

              <br>

              <b>Your score doesn't represent an inalterable character trait or a genetic propensity.</b>
              <br>
              <p>It's merely a measure of your behavior and you can change that.</p>
